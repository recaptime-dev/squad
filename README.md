# Welcome to the hub for squad members

Most of the squad members have developer to maintainer access (depending on the department they're currently in)
to most of the repositories in both Mauiunm GitLab instance (here) and GitLab SaaS, alongside GitHub.

## How to mention the crew?

> **Note**: These also apply to anyone outside Recap Time Squad.

* Remember that tagging `@recaptime-dev/squad` will trigger email notifications to ALL users under the subgroup, which might overwelm things on the backend easily.[^1] We recommend directly mentioning the individual members themselves.
* Only tag everyone in case of:
  * emergency async meetings, especially as required by @RecapTime/legal team.
  * important org-wide announcements that might affect the operations of the organization

[^1]: That mistake was happened in GitLab SaaS at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19861#note_242645866>, but @ajhalili2006 might forgot what issue is it for that within GitLab team's namespace.
