# Reply templates for maintainers

Here is a list of common **reply messages** shared by core team members to help them respond to issues. Some of them are adopted from [OpenCollective's meta issue tracker](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/tree/main/.github/MAINTAINER_REPLY_TEMPLATES).

You can add those to your [GitHub saved replies settings](https://github.com/settings/replies) and [GitLab comment templates](https://mau.dev/-/profile/comment_templates) ([alternative link for GitLab SaaS](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/comment_templates)).
